# Images   
- to add an image you need to use an `<img>` tag. This will be followed by src, alt, and title inside the tag with the appropriate input.  
- height and width are also a part of the images and manipulating it.  
-  Deciding where to place the img is important too. When writing the code location of the code is also important. You can do the following in a paragraph as far as placement goes.  
    - before a paragraph  
    - inside the paragraph  
    - in the middle of a paragraph  
- You can align from left to right with your img. You can also align from top , middle , and bottom.  

**Three rules for creating images**  
    - save images in the right format  
    - save images at the right size  
    - use the correct resolution  


# Color  
- colors are important but can be a pain at times,  
- you want to stay consistent  
- Every color on a computer screen is created by  mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.  
- Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like
Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.  

**RGB Values**  
_rgb(102,205,170)
This color is made up of the
following values:
102 red
205 green
170 blue_  
**Hex Codes**    
_The value of the red, 102, is
expressed as 66 in hexadecimal
code. The 205 of the green is
expressed as cd and the 170 of
the blue equates to aa._  
**Color Names**    
_MediumAquaMarine
There are 147 color names
supported by browsers (this
color is MediumAquaMarine).
Most consider this to be a
limited color palette, and it is
hard to remember the name for
each of the colors so (apart from
white and black) they are not
commonly used._    
**Hue**  
_Hue is near to the colloquial idea
of color. Technically speaking
however, a color can also have
saturation and brightness as
well as hue_     
**Saturation**  
_Saturation refers to the amount
of gray in a color. At maximum
saturation, there would be no
gray in the color. At minimum
saturation, the color would be
mostly gray._    
**Brightness**  
_Brightness (or "value") refers
to how much black is in a color.
At maximum brightness, there
would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the
color would be very dark._    
- Along with all of the listed above, you can also adjust opacity, contrast, hue, saturation, and lightness. HSLA is for the above and the A stands for alpha.
# Text    
- _The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into two groups:_     
- That's right you've guessed it, You can also change the text appearance just like everything else. Size, shape, style, color. However, you need to make sure you are specifically setting the font format to be proper with the site that the user is going to use like Chrome, Firefox and so on so forth.
