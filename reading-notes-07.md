**Basic Table Structure**  

- Table has a few different tags. `<table>` ( element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.)    
- `<tr>`  stands for table row. You indicate the start of each row using the opening 
- `<td>`. Each cell of a table is
represented using a `<td>` tag.   
- `<th>` is for table heading which is self explanatory. 

**Spanning Columns**  

- Sometimes you may need the
entries in a table to stretch
across more than one column.  

**Spanning Rows**  

-The rows pan attribute can be
used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.  

**Long Tables**  

- `<thead>` The headings of the table should
sit inside the tag.  
- `<tbody>` the body needs to sit inside of this tag. 
- `<tfoot>` is going to be your footer and the footer belongs inside this tag.

**Document object model**

- string  
- number
