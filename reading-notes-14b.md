**Working in Groups/ Teams**  

- In this particular reading Rozovsky was someone who had some interesting scenario's where she had been put in teams and had some unusual experiences. Some of them might be strange to one but yet oh so familiar to others. She had decided that she wasn't happy with some experiences she had in some groups/ teams. And she had a blast in other teams.  

- Rozovsky thought that being able to form a team with people she had known and were like minded was the best fit until she realized that in-fact, it wasn't what she was looking for. She started to look for other ways to have better experiences.

- As the years went by and she graduated from college she had been in other rolls with much different teams than she had been paired up with in the past. She had experienced a great time where she was more productive and enjoyed the atmosphere that she was in.  

- Later on down the road she was hired by Google and was put on a team that was dedicated in specific research regarding the interactions people had when working in groups. Not to long after analyzing how teams and people of different backgrounds and expertise. She had concluded that being in a group of people who had much difference to bring to the table was stronger and yet more productive.   

- Honestly, there were a few different opinions regarding working with groups of people like minded and others who weren't. I personally like working in teams because I enjoy learning from the people around me. At times I can be a great leader and other times I realize that this may be a time where I may not know much and need to inhale the valuable information around me. This was a similar experience that Rozovsky had and found that she enjoyed all of this and felt at a comfortable level around her teammates. The research went well and a lot of data was produced to prove the learning styles and interactions that people have when partnered up with diversity.
