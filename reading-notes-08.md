**Writing Links in HTML / CSS**

- Linking to other sites : Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link. You can also click on the links in between the tags and it will take you to the designated location. You can pretty much link just about anything you want. Page to page or web address to web address.

- Directory Structure : Everything is listed/ organized in the order of a parent then a child. There are also grandparent and grandchild set ups as well. Pretty much a sub sub folder set up.

**Relative URLS**  
- Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
- If you want to do email links you just need to start off with a mailto: and it will create a mail link with whatever name you put in it.

_**target can be used to open a link in a new window._** 

- CSS Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as it is in its own little box or block. Each of these can me manipulated by different block type tags. You can contain them and control them in many different ways.
