**Object Literal**  
 _What is an object?_  
 - Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.  
 - In an object: variables become known as properties!  
 - In an object: functions become know as methods.  
 - Creating an object: Literal Notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.  
 - Accessing an object and dot notation: You access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. You can also access properties using square brackets.   
 - Construction Notation: The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. You can then add properties and methods to the object.  
 - Updating an object: To update the value of the properties, use dot notation or square brackets. They work on objects created using literal or constructor notation. To delete a property, use the delete keyword.
