## Summary

- In this reading it covered a bunch of new tags.
- These tags will alow you to manipulate the HTML and CSS to add some extra flavors. Here are a few examples of the tags that I read about. 

- `headings` there are different levels of heading tags you can use. i.e `h1` `h2` `h3` `h4` `h5` and so on so forth.
- `p` these are for paragraphs. I think this speaks for itself.  
- `b` and `i` bold and italic.  
- `sup` and `sub` is something new to me but seems to be pretty useful. 
<sup> is used for superscript which would be used for dates and math problems where as <sub> is for subscript which is commonly found in chemistry formulas.    
  `br /` is for line breaks  
  `hr /` is for horizontal rules like adding a horizontal line between a paragraph.  
  `strong` and `em` would be used for getting the readers eyes to specific areas like that might need more attention than most. The <em> emphasis is used to maybe draw attention to a specific word but lightly drawn to the word in italics.  
  `blockquote` used for quotes that are longer than normal (i.e extending through an entire paragraph.  
  `q` would be for smaller quote that doesn't take up an entire paragraph.  
  `abbr` speaks for itself for abbreviations.  
  `cite` also speaks for itself as a citation  
  `dfn` is used to define a word.  
  `address` is self explanatory in the sense of being able to add a web address.  
  `ins` and `del` when you want to display something added and changed but keeping both to the text with and underline and a line through it.  
  `s` would be used like when Walmart or any other store does a discount or roll back with a cross out of a previous price.  
  
  ## CSS  
  - CSS is basically used to give different styling techniques to the web page. You may want to add color to text, change font, color or style the background and so on so forth. You can do a lot with CSS.
